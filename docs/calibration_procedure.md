## 1. Accelerometer Calibration

### Purpose
- Determines sensor offset and scale factors
- Corrects for misalignment and manufacturing variations

### Procedure
1. Preparation
   - Place quadcopter on a completely flat, level surface
   - Ensure no vibrations or external movements
   - Connect to calibration interface

2. Orientation Sequence
   ```
   Orientation Sequence:
   1. Level (Flat)
   2. Upside Down
   3. Nose Up (90 degrees)
   4. Nose Down (90 degrees)
   5. Left Side Down (90 degrees)
   6. Right Side Down (90 degrees)
   ```

3. Calibration Steps
   ```bash
   # Firmware Command
   calibration_start(CALIBRATION_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER)
   ```

### Expected Outcome
- Computed offset for each axis
- Scale factor corrections
- Improved sensor accuracy

## 2. Gyroscope Calibration

### Purpose
- Measures and removes gyroscope bias
- Ensures accurate rotation measurements

### Procedure
1. Preparation
   - Place quadcopter on a completely stable surface
   - Ensure absolute stillness during calibration
   - Maintain constant temperature

2. Calibration Process
   ```bash
   # Firmware Command
   calibration_start(CALIBRATION_TYPE_GYROSCOPE)
   ```

3. Key Considerations
   - Perform in a vibration-free environment
   - Allow 2-3 minutes for thermal stabilization
   - Avoid drafts or air conditioning

### Expected Outcome
- Precise zero-rate offset for each axis
- Improved angular velocity measurements

## 3. Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) Calibration

### Purpose
- Synchronizes ESC response
- Sets consistent minimum and maximum pulse widths
- Ensures uniform motor behavior

### Procedure
1. Preparation
   ```
   Required Equipment:
   - Fully charged battery
   - Calibration power supply
   - Safe, open area
   ```

2. Calibration Sequence
   ```
   Calibration Steps:
   1. Disconnect propellers
   2. Connect battery
   3. Power on transmitter
   4. Place throttle at maximum
   5. Power on ESCs
   6. Wait for tone sequence
   7. Lower throttle to minimum
   8. Wait for confirmation tones
   ```

3. Firmware Command
   ```bash
   calibration_start(CALIBRATION_TYPE_ESC)
   ```

### Expected Outcome
- Synchronized ESC response
- Consistent motor speed ranges
- Improved flight stability

## 4. Radio Receiver Calibration

### Purpose
- Maps controller inputs accurately
- Ensures precise control response
- Corrects channel inversions

### Procedure
1. Preparation
   - Ensure clear line of sight
   - Check battery levels
   - Use main flight controller

2. Calibration Sequence
   ```
   Channel Movement:
   1. Throttle: Full Up and Down
   2. Pitch: Forward and Backward
   3. Roll: Left and Right
   4. Yaw: Left and Right Rotation
   5. Auxiliary Channels: Full Range
   ```

3. Firmware Command
   ```bash
   calibration_start(CALIBRATION_TYPE_RADIO_RECEIVER)
   ```

### Expected Outcome
- Accurate channel mapping
- Normalized input ranges
- Improved control precision

## 5. Full System Calibration

### Purpose
- Comprehensive system-wide calibration
- Ensures overall system accuracy

### Procedure
```bash
# Perform full system calibration
calibration_result_t full_result;
calibration_perform_full_system(&full_result);

# Save calibration data
calibration_save(&full_result);
```

## Common Troubleshooting

### Calibration Failure Indicators
- Inconsistent sensor readings
- Unexpected motor behavior
- Erratic flight characteristics

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verify physical sensor mounting
2. Check for electromagnetic interference
3. Ensure stable power supply
4. Repeat calibration procedure
5. Consult technical support

## Safety Precautions

1. Always remove propellers during ESC calibration
2. Perform calibration in a controlled environment
3. Use battery with sufficient charge
4. Keep calibration area clear of obstacles
5. Wear safety glasses

## Recommended Calibration Frequency
- Before first flight
- After significant crashes
- Quarterly for regular users
- Annually for occasional pilots

## Logging and Verification

### Calibration Log
```bash
# Check calibration status
calibration_status_t status;
calibration_get_status(CALIBRATION_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER, &status);
```
